    "[The Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is an example of cellular automation which was devised by the mathematician John Conway in 1970. The game is played on a rectangular grid of \"cells\". Each cell is adjacent to up to eight neighbor cells. Initially, each cell is either alive or dead. At each timestep, the states (alive/dead) of the cells update simultaneously according to the following rules:\n",

    "In this part of the homework, we will look at a dataset which contains the final score of all NCAA football games between Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) teams during the 2023 regular season. We will model this data as a directed graph where each team is a node, and for each game, there is a directed edge from the winning team to the losing team. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if we only had four teams (Team A, Team B, Team C, and Team D) and Team A beat Team B, Team A beat Team C, Team B beat Team C, and Team C beat Team D, our directed graph would look like this: \n",

    "&#9989;  **Question 3.5 (5 points)**: There are over 100 FBS teams, but each team only gets to play a few of the other teams. However, fans still want to be able to argue that their team is better than another team, even if their team didn't play and beat that other team. One way to do this is using the \"transitive property\". For example, if Team A beat Team B and Team B beat Team C, then Team A's fans can say \"Since Team A is better than Team B, and Team B is better than Team C, Team A must be better than Team C.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't a perfectly logical argument since there is some luck in sports, and so the \"better\" team doesn't always win. Furthermore, if Team A beats Team B, Team B beats Team C, and Team C beats Team A, then the fanbases of all three teams can argue that their team is better than a team they lost to. Of course, arguments about sports are often not based on logic. :P\n",

    "We can extend this \"transitive property\"-based reasoning by using more intermediate teams. In general, if Team $A_0$ beat Team $A_1$, Team $A_1$ beat Team $A_2$, ..., and Team $A_{n-1}$ beat Team $A_n$, then Team $A_0$'s fans can claim that Team $A_0$ is better than Team $A_n$. Obviously, the more intermediate teams you need, the less credible the argument sounds. The website https://www.myteamisbetterthanyourteam.com/ helps fans find a shortest path of comparisons to claim that their team is better than someone else's team. \n",

    "**Do this**: Our goal is to make a function that takes in the directed graph that you created along with two strings called `my_team` and `their_team`, and then prints a sequence of statements of the form \"[TEAM NAME] beat [TEAM NAME]\" which can be used to argue that `my_team` is better than `their team` (assuming such a sequence exists). To do this, the function will first use the `shortest_path()` method to generate a list of teams $[A_0,A_1,\\ldots,A_n]$ which forms the shortest path from `my_team` to `their_team`. Then, it will iterate through this list to print out the sequence of statements \"Team $A_i$ beat Team $A_{i+1}$\"."
